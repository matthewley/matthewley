        <p><strong>😂 I really admire Mike Tyson for his legendary boxing skills and the way he overcame challenges in and out of the ring. His speed, power, and resilience make him a truly iconic and inspirational figure in the world of sports.</strong></p>

              <p>Michael Gerard Tyson (born June 30, 1966) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 2005. Nicknamed "Iron Mike" and "Kid Dynamite" in his early career, and later known as "The Baddest Man on the Planet", Tyson is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990.</p></td>

              <p style="text-align: justify">Tyson win his first 19 professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. Claiming his first belt at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old, Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title. He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, as well as the only heavyweight to unify them in succession. The following year, Tyson became the lineal champion when he knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round. In 1990, Tyson was knocked out by underdog Buster Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in history. </p></td>

              <p>Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6, 1985, in Albany, New York. He defeated Hector Mercedes via first-round TKO. He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional. Fighting frequently, Tyson won 26 of his first 28 fights by KO or TKO; 16 of those came in the first round. The quality of his opponents gradually increased to journeyman fighters and borderline contenders, like James tillis, David Jaco, Jesse Ferguson, Mitch Green, and Marvis Frazier. His win streak attracted media attention and Tyson was billed as the next great heavyweight champion. D'Amato died in November 1985, relatively early into Tyson's professional career, and some speculate that his death was the catalyst to many of the troubles Tyson was to experience as his life and career progressed.</p></td>

              <p style="text-align: center">Tyson was&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;magazine's  Fighter of the Year in 1986 and 1988.&nbsp;A  1998 ranking of &quot;The Greatest Heavyweights of All-Time&quot; by&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;magazine  placed Tyson at number 14 on the list.&nbsp;Despite  criticism of facing underwhelming competition during his run as champion,  Tyson's knockout power and intimidation factor made him the sport's most  dynamic box-office draw.&nbsp;According to Douglas Quenqua of&nbsp;The NewYork Times,  &quot;The [1990s] began with Mike Tyson, considered by many to be the last  great heavyweight champion, losing his title to the little-known Buster  Douglas. Seven years later, Mr. Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ear in a  heavyweight champion bout—hardly a proud moment for the sport.&rdquo; <br>
                He is remembered for his  attire of black trunks, black shoes with no socks, and a plain white towel fit  around his neck in place of a traditional robe, as well as his habit of rapidly  pacing the ring before the start of a fight. In his prime, Tyson rarely took a  step back and had never been knocked down or seriously challenged. According  to&nbsp;Martial Arts World Report, it gave Tyson an Honorable Mention in its  Ten Greatest Heavyweights of All Time rather than a ranking because longevity  is a factor and the peak period of Tyson's career lasted only about 5 years <br>
                BoxRec
                &nbsp;currently ranks Tyson at number 20 among the  greatest boxers that had their last fight at heavyweight. In&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;magazine's list of the 80  Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years, released in 2002, Tyson was ranked at  number 72. He is ranked number 16 on&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;magazine's 2003 list of  100 greatest punchers of all time. Tyson has defeated&nbsp;11 Boxers&nbsp;for the world heavyweight title, the  seventh-most in history.<br>
                On June 12, 2011, Tyson was  inducted to the&nbsp;International Boxing Hall Of Fame&nbsp;alongside legendary Mexican champion&nbsp;Julio Cesar Chavez, light  welterweight champion&nbsp;Kosta Tyzu, and actor/screenwriter&nbsp;Sylvester Stallone.&nbsp;In  2011, Bleacher Report omitted Tyson from its list of top 10 heavyweights,  saying that &quot;Mike Tyson is not a top 10 heavyweight. He killed the  fighters he was supposed to beat, but when he fought another elite fighter, he  always lost. I'm not talking about some of those B-level fighters he took a  belt from. I'm talking about the handful of good boxers he fought throughout  his career.&quot; <br>
                In 2013, Tyson was inducted  into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame and headlined the induction ceremony.&nbsp;Tyson  was inducted into the Southern Nevada Hall of Fame in 2015 along with four  other inductees with ties to Southern Nevada. <br>
                Tyson reflected on his  strongest opponents in ten categories for a 2014 interview with&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;magazine,  including best jab, best defense, fastest hands, fastest feet, best chin,  smartest, strongest, best puncher, best boxer, and best overall. <br>
                In 2017,&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;magazine  ranked Tyson as number 9 of 20 heavyweight champions based on a poll of panelists  that included trainers, matchmakers, media, historians, and boxers, including: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Trainers: Teddy Atlas, Pat Burns, Virgil Hunter, and Don Turner</li>
                <li>Matchmakers: Eric Bottjer, Don Chargin, Don Elbaum, Bobby Goodman, Ron  Katz, Mike Marchionte, Russell Peltz, and Bruce Trampler.</li>
                <li>Media: Al Bernstein, Ron Borges, Gareth A Davies, Norm Frauenheim, Jerry  Izenberg, Harold Lederman, Paulie Malignaggi, Dan Rafael, and Michael Rosenthal</li>
                <li>Historians: Craig Hamilton, Steve Lott, Don McRae, Bob Mee, Clay Moyle,  Adam Pollack, and Randy Roberts</li>
                <li>Boxers: Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson participated in the poll, but  neither fighter ranked himself. Instead, a weighted average from the other  panelists was assigned to their respective slots on their ballots.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In 2020, Bill Caplan  of&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;magazine listed Tyson as number 17 of the 20 greatest  heavyweights of all time. Tyson spoke with&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;magazine in 2020  about his six greatest victories, which included Trevor Berbick, Pinklon  Thomas, Tony Tucker, Tyrell Biggs, Larry Holmes, and Michael Spinks.&nbsp;In  2020, CBS Sports boxing experts Brian Campbell and Brent Brookhouse ranked the  top 10 heavyweights of the last 50 years and Tyson was ranked number 7. </p></td>
